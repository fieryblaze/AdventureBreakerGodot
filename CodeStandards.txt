Folder Names: CCC

Scripts: CCC .gd same name as node attached to

Member Variables: cC

Member Functions: CCC

Constants: CAPS

Nodes: CCC contains description of node type ex->BrickStaticBody

Scenes: C_C_C

All other file names: C_C_C


*** Referencing other scenes or nodes ***

Instance should be a descriptive name, which can be the same name as the object
being instanced.
Loaded or preloaded reference should have 'Ref' at the end. ex: paddleRef


*** Commenting ***

Comments explaining the next block of code should be preceded and followed by a
double hash, with a space buffer. When multiple lines are needed, the middle
lines should follow a single hash with a space buffer, and line up with the
lines above.

## This is a single line explanation comment. ##

## This is a		   ##
 # multi-line
## explanation comment ##

Inline comments, comments for empty code blocks, or unimplemented code comments,
should just be one hash with no space buffer. Inline comments should never be
used to explain a piece of code, only for known bugs, current workarounds, and
unimplemented code.

This is an #inline comment
#this is code that needs to be filled in

Any large functions or code blocks should have a hash followed by 'END', then a
space, then a repeat of the first line of the block (colons not included). This
should be lined up with the first line of the code block.

#END SomeLargeFunction()

All comments should line up with the code block that contains them

*Correct*
func Blah():
	## Check if ready to print, and then print 'blah' ##
	if print:
		#print blah here
		pass
	#END if print
#END Blah()

*Incorrect*
func Blah():
## Check if ready to print, and then print 'blah' ##
	if print:
#print blah here
		pass
#END if print
	#END Blah()
